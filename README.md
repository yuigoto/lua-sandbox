YX : Lua Sandbox :crescent_moon:
================================

> A repository for my Lua sandbox, a project I use to learn, test and build some code.

I tend to have multiple sandbox projects, one for each language and/or framework I use and try, so I can always have a place to test code and break thing without interfering in my projects.

Most of these sandboxes are private, but since I'm aiming on writing a (very) small blog on learning the _Lua_ programming language, I thought it would be a good idea to have an open repository, so people who follow my texts might take a glance at what I do and how I do things sometimes.

Since I'm not a developer by default (coming from Advertising and Marketing), maybe my approach might help people from the same background (or non-devs, in general) learning a bit about programming (or not really :sweat_smile:).

## Dependencies

All you need is a text editor (I personally use VS Code) and a Lua interpreter of any version, though most of the code here will be targeted towards version `5.1.x`.

My local machine uses **Lua for Windows**, but you're free to choose and use whatever you feel like it's good for you.
